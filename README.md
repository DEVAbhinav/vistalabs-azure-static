## Deployment
This site is deployed to the VIstalabs managed edge, presently backed by Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions automation.

### Deploy to VIstalabs managed edge (Azure Static Web Apps)

1. Create an Azure Static Web App in the Azure Portal
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Azure will automatically add the deployment token to your repository secrets
4. Push to the `master` branch to trigger deployment

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4173` in your browser. Run the Playwright regression suite with `npm test`. After `npm run build`, inspect the static export with `npm run preview`.

### Asset Optimization

Use `npm run optimize:images` whenever you add images to `public/portfolio` to generate compressed PNGs and WebP variants automatically.

### Booking Form API

The booking form posts to `api/bookings`, an Azure Function that sends emails through Resend. Configure the following secrets in your hosting environment:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev # optional, defaults to this trial address
RESEND_TO_EMAIL=abhinavpandey.1996@gmail.com
RESEND_CC_EMAIL=britz.listen@gmail.com
```

For local Azure Functions development add these keys to `api/local.settings.json` (ignored in Git).

## Technology Stack

- React 18
- VIstalabs managed edge across Azure and GSC regions
